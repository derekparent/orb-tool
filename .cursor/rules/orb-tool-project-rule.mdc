# Oil Record Book Tool Rules

## Git
- Use SSH: git@github.com:derekparent/orb-tool.git
- Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:
- Never mention AI in commits

## Code Style
- Python with type hints always
- Flask patterns (blueprints for routes)
- Mobile-first HTML/CSS
- SQLite for database

## Project Constraints
- Handle temporary connectivity drops gracefully (don't lose user input on network blip)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Generate Excel handover for Gold crew
- Real users = handle errors properly

## When Done
Say "Done." - no summaries unless asked.---
alwaysApply: true
